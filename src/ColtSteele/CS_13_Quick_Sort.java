     * The basic idea of this algo is not to sort everything
     * in a linear fashion. But rather break it up into chunks
     * similar to the way that Merge Sort Does it
     *
     * For Quick Sort it's all about the pivots.
     *
     * Take a random number, as your pivot, put everything that is less the
     * pivot on the left side, put everything greater than the pivot on the right side.
     *
     * Then apply the same idea on either side of the pivot over and over again, until
     * you end up with nothing left to use as a pivot. (Usually done recursively)
     *
     * At that point your array should be sorted.
     *
     * uses two layers of helper functions
     * 1st function is the initial helper function to create the recursion
     * 2nd function is a utility found that does the pivoting and modification of the array
     * (make sure you are going from the GIVEN start to the GIVEN end)
     *
     * Time Complexity: O(n^2)
     * Since worst case we have to sort something that is already sorted.
     * So we pick a value as our pivot, and more everything bigger to right
     * and everything smaller to the left.
     * If the value we pick is already in the right place. We essentially just take the
     * pivot and compare it to everything else in the array, every time.
     * Another way to think about it:
     * So we pick a number - first for loop
     * Compare it to everything else - second for loop
     *
     * Diagram it out
